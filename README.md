# WebDevRef
A resource reference blog for web developers. From concepts to tutorials to project walkthroughs, every resource at hand.

### Tech stack
- NextJS
- GraphCMS (for content management)

## Goal 
- Having a technical blog helps me keep track of my learning, and since our brains can only hold so much, revisiting well drafted posts serves as a decent revision tactic - to brush up concepts.
- Constant updates and changes in tech pushes me to keep the blogs up-to date, thus keeping me responsible.

## Learnings
- As tech is ever-changing and so does the learning curve, technical blogging keeps us accountable to dive the depth.
- Learnt how not to use "useRef" hook.

## Challenges
- Had a surprisingly long strife with code syntax highlighting. Later figured out the markdown converter and highlighter combo.
- Displaying "estimated reading time". Took the wrong route of using useRef hook.

## Prospective
- Option to filter posts by category.
- Newsletter subscriptions for fresh blogs or updates on old ones.
